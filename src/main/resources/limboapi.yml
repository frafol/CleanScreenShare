limbo:

  # This function enables connection to the server created by the LimboAPI plugin, instead of a physical server.
  # It can be useful if you don't want to create a "Control" server and forgo having a map where you can perform controls.
  # This doesn't impact performance that much since Velocity is completely asynchronous.
